# The power of data  
In traditional field of statistics, data is defined as an individual numerical figures collected by observation that can be often categorized as quantitative and qualitative data. Today's definition of data ranges from the simple numerical representation of facts to the complex representation of the  physical world - including audio and video data. To elaborate the definition of data, I used a metaphor of Checka, a traditional beverage of Konso people wo are located in the southern part of Ethiopia. As a person who born and has grown up in Konso, and drinks data daily, I am happy to elaborate data how Check is made.
