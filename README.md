# The power of data  
In the traditional field of statistics, data is defined as individual numerical figure collected by the observation (measurement) that can be often categorized as quantitative and qualitative data. Today's definition of data ranges from the simple numerical representation of facts to the complex representation of the physical world - including audio and video data. To elaborate on the definition of data, I am going to use a metaphor of Checka, a traditional beverage of the Konso people who are located in the southern part of Ethiopia. As a person who was born and grew up in Konso, and drinks data daily, I am happy to elaborate on the defination of data with process of making Checka.
